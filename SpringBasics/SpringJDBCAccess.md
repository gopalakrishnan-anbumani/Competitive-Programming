##JdbcTemplate
Spring JDBC module provides many template classes which can be used to create an abstract layer connecting an application to the database.

JdbcTemplate is the core class from org.springframework.jdbc.core package, methods of this class are used to perform various database operations.

JdbcTemplate simplifies the use of JDBC API by executing core JDBC workflow, hence developer need not concentrate on database specific tasks such as loading database driver and connection management.
